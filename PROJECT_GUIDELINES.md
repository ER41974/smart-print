# Project Guidelines

This document defines how the **Smart Print** project evolves and is managed.

## Mandatory Reference Policy

*   **Primary Reference**: `README.md` is the primary source of truth for the project's purpose and scope.
*   **Evolution**: This `PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md` file governs how changes are proposed and implemented.

## Rules for Proposing Features

1.  **Alignment**: No new feature may be proposed without explicitly referencing the relevant section of `README.md` that it supports or extends.
2.  **Stability First**: Stability and reliability always take precedence over new features.
3.  **Compatibility**: All changes must maintain strict compatibility with **WPF** and **.NET 8 LTS**.

## Rules for AI Agents

1.  **Context**: Agents must read `README.md` and `PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md` **before** performing any actions on the codebase.
2.  **Justification**: Agents must explicitly state which section of these documents they are relying on when making changes or proposing solutions.
